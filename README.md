# Awesome Event IDs

> Collection of Event ID resources useful for Digital Forensics and Incident Response

In incidents, analysts are often faced with the problem of interpreting unknown event IDs.
The event itself does not always contain the desired information.
In addition, it is impossible to remember them all, given the huge number of event IDs and log sources.
